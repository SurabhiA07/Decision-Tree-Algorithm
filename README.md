## Aim
The aim of this analysis is to build and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier model for classifying Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
## Description
- Loading Dataset: The analysis begins by loading the dataset containing information about the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species of Iris flowers.
- Data Preparation: The dataset is then prepared by splitting it into features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the target variable (species).
- Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the testing data. Accuracy score is calculated to measure the model's performance.
## Requirements
- Python environment with necessary libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
- DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn
- plot_tree function from scikit-learn.tree
## Conclusion
- The Decision Tree classifier achieved an accuracy score, indicating how well it predicts the Iris flower species based on the provided features.
- The decision tree visualization helps in understanding the decision-making process of the classifier, showing the split criteria at each node based on feature values.
- Overall, the analysis demonstrates the process of building, evaluating, and visualizing a Decision Tree classifier for the Iris dataset, which can be extended to other classification tasks as well.
